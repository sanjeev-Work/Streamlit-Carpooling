"""
This script assigns passengers to cabs for hotel, support, and airport rides
and outputs results to an Excel workbook. It enforces a maximum of 3 travelers
per cab. Within each predefined group (as returned by Parser.ride_to_*), it
tries to keep people using the same `app` together whenever possible, but never
at the expense of increasing the total number of cabs. Cab identifiers use:
- Two-digit numbers for hotel rides ('01', '02', ...)
- Three-digit numbers for support rides ('100', '101', ...)
- Letters for airport rides ('A', 'B', ..., 'Z', 'AA', 'BB', ...)
No cab with exactly one occupant will be recordedâ€”those riders get a blank entry
unless they are marked as a personal ride. Each non-personal cab ID is prefixed
with "Cab ".
